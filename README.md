# fabiya
A basic Discord bot
# setup things
- discord api keys (obviously)
- a text file with your api keys
- a server to add fabiya to
# future things
- support for a server economy
- an overall rewrite
# how it works
- add fabiya to a server to get access to user-created commands
- users can create "react" or "redirect" commands
- all commands are saved, no need to worry about them being deleted
- if two or more commands share the same key, fabiya chooses one to respond to at random
